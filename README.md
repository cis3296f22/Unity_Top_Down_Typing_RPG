# Top Down Typing RPG
This application can be played on both mobile and desktop device. The game will be a 2D topdown RPG in which the user can control a player to walk around the map and interact with enemies. The user will be introduced with easier enemies where they are allowed to make mistakes and learn the mechanics of the game. As they progress, the levels and enemies will increase in difficulty, but they will also be given additional assistance in the form of power ups (ex. Slow time for a period, extra health). A GUI interface would be created for the user to interact with, and it would progress in a side scroller style.
